# uWRF Evaluation System
This repo contains the code used to evaluate the WRF runs done by CUERG @ CUNY CCNY.

Once you "git clone" this file onto the CUERG server, edit the paths at the beginning of the runP01.sh and then run the bash script. The output is an html file with the results of the forecast.
